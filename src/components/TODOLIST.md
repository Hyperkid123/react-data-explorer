## TODO
* Close the editor (OK / Cancel --> cancel restore the state when it was first opened)
* Edit a concrete chart
* Wrapper functions for axes

## Brainstorm
To edit the chart:
* have for each part of the chart a component:
    * wrapper -> group -> chart
* each component is responsible for the one element
* this would allow to add more components to one form
