## TODO
* Add new chart
* Edit a concrete chart
* Wrapper functions for axes


## To edit the chart options:
* Edit live, save old values of the whole chart, on pressing cancel restore these values.

## Brainstorm
To edit the chart:
* have for each part of the chart a component:
    * wrapper -> group -> chart
* each component is responsible for the one element
* this would allow to add more components to one form
