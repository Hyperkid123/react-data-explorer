/*
Props: Ids for the chart wrappers to render
    - allows to control which charts to render from the store, without changing the stored elements.


This component will have to take care of the chart rendering:
- can take care of the data in the top level and pass down everything as prop
    - CON: more component rerenders, has to contain logic for all the levels
    - PRO: one connected component, easier to change data logic
- OR can allow subsequent props to get the data from the store and pass down only id's
    - CON: all components need to be connected to the Store
    - PRO: component can access any data, and can move the logic to their component, less rerenders
